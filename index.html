Thursday September 1, 2016 began my very first trip
to Los Angeles, California. I hopped on a Southwest
flight at 6am, just to arrive a short 4 hours later.
LA was beautiful. The climate was perfect. I took
snaps of absolutely everything. I had my itinerary
planned, I could not wait to do everything I could
think of! I had always dreamed of going to LA.

My first stop was Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. It was
amazing! After that, I rode through the city, stopping
at local boutiques before arriving at my final
destination - the nail shop. This nail shop in
particular is Instagram famous. All the celebrities and
big names come to this salon. When I walked in I could
definitely see why. From the crystal chandeliers to the
velvet decor on the wall, the salon was decked
out lavishly! I was served a mimosa with my full
set and enjoyed every minute of it. It was by far
the best experience I have ever had at a nail shop.

Another big highlight of my trip was the tour of
the city and of course the beach. I had never been
to the beach before so I made this a priority. I
must admit I was actually pretty scared to get in
the water. I had never seen the ocean before and
it was intimidating, even though I can swim!
After standing in the water for a bit I took plenty
of beach photos and candids. I had an awesome time.

I ended my trip with a visit to my family in
Oceanside, CA. It was a goregous drive down the
I-85 alongside the ocean. After arriving I walked
in the door to a surprise party for my birthday!
All of my California family was there with good
home cooked food and a buttercream icing cake.
I was so appreciate of everything. To top it off
they took me back to the beach. All in all, it was
an unforgettable trip. I left my family and got
on the plane home the next day with every intention
of returning for my next birthday.
